# Test task for CyberCraft

## Description
In this application, I have implemented a form where you can enter the login of a GitHub user and get the GitHub name and the names of the user's repositories.
Data from the GitHub is extracted and processed using GraphQL.
I also wrote tests for the project using Rspec and vcr.
Added a code linter (Rubocop).
GitHub Flow was used for the project.
And the application is deployed on Fly.io service
